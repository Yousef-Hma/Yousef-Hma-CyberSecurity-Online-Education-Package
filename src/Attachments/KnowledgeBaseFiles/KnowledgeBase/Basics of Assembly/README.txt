	used x86 assembly instructions along with an extended example 
	of how they are used and how essential operations are carried
	out in a low-level language such as this. Of note is the fact 
	that there are two commonly used syntaxes in assembly, for that
	reason, kindly check the components of the Syntax folder.

	Without further ado..
